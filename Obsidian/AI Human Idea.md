# AI Human Idea

- need to create training pipeline

## pipeline

inputs:
- **face**
- **eyes**
- **body**
- **hands**
- thoughts? *maybe in a later gen*
- words spoken/sounds?

need:
face tracking model
body tracking model
see if theres a model that can do all
(from video)
- eventually use sora to generate training data
- or use issach sim for general walking training
- then **finetune** with real peoples tracked vids
- (use issach sim/gym environment)


## Softwares needed

- Issac Sim
- Issac Lab (to programmatically describe the models)
	- Python
- Issac gym
